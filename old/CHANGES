Proposed:
    Any whitespace after author can be ignored and parse for the name until a newline is found
        This is instead of the tab character
    Rework parser to match a standard compiler
        Any whitespace after a datatype is fine, don't rely on a tab character being there.
        Comments after variable definition rely on '//' or matching '/*' '*/' pairs
        Multiline commenting in variable definitions
    Auto output from a doc target
        Generated ebnf (or similar) graphing format file to illustrate data type format
            Maybe use Andrew Rocks syntrax to generate the diagram
    Add custom jenkins job to auto-regenerate wb types on the server
    Come up with a new Whiteboard class directory structure to separate the generated files, the parsed files and any customisation classes which inherit from the generated files.
